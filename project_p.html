<h2>3100 - Project Description</h2>
<h3>Main Page</h3>
<ul>
    <li> This will be our home page for users who aren't signed in. </li>
    <li> This page will be designed using a side by side border, with the left side having 
        some information on the application and the right side having two buttons: sign up and log in.</li>
    <li> When the sign up button is clicked a pop up comes up (see more information below).</li>
    <li> When the log in button is clicked a pop up comes up (see more information below).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Log In</h3>
<ul>
    <li> This pop up page follows the same template as the sign up pop up.</li>
    <li> It asks for a username and password, you click the log in button.</li>
    <li> If the user enters the correct details, they get redirected to the homepage (see more information below).</li>
    <li> Else an error comes up saying Incorrect password.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Homepage</h3>

        <li> The user's first name and username.</li>
        <li> Number of followers and following.</li>
        <li> The rest of the border will be posts made by the user sorted by time.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The center border will includes posts made by all users of the application.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Right at the top of the page is a form that asks teh user to compose a post.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The right border has a log out button whih redirects the user to the main page, this border also 
    has a section cut out for notifications.

<h3> Edit User </h3>

    <li> This pop up gives the user the ability to change:</li>
    <ul>
        <li> The avatar (we will give a selection of avatars to chose from).</li>
        <li> First and last name, the username can't be changed. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    <h2> Sign up page</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The user would be prompted to fill out a form to set up his account.    
        </li>
        <li>
            The form will be displayed as a pop-up page with the Home Page in the background.
