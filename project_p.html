<h2>3100 - Project Description</h2>
<p> Our project will be an interactive kids game.</p>
<p>The Gaming Platform will be used to test your knowledge/IQ and to see where you rank among others</p>
<p>We have two default admin users for testing purposes:
    <br>
        afrahx - 1234
        <br>
        sylviax - 1234</p>
<h3>Main Page</h3>
<ul>
    <li> This will be our landing page for users who aren't signed in. </li>
    <li> This page will be designed using flexbox, the left flexbox showcases our logo 
        and the right shows a form for the user to login.
    </li>
    <li> Below the login form is an link to sign in if you don't have an existing account.</li>
    <li> A popup with for sign up comes up when this link is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Log In</h3>
<ul>
    <li> The user needs to be previosuly registered to log in.</li>
    <li>If the user account does not exist or if the user entered wrong information or 
        if the user did not fill a required field, an error box shows up telling the user to try again.
    </li>
    <li> If the user was sucessful, they get redirected to the landing page for users who are signed in.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Homepage</h3>
<ul>
    <li> This is the homepage for admin/non-admin users who have been authorized </li>
    <li> An automatic popup welcomming the user to the application always shows up,
        to stop this automatic feature, the user can select the do not show again checkbox
        and this gets updated in the database through the backend.
    </li>
    <li> A leaderboard showing the top 5 users of the application is seen on the left. </li>
    <li> The leaderboard which is sorted by number of games won includes their rank, their username, number of games won and a smiley
        button, clicking on this button sends a notiffication to the user saying you have smiled at them.
    </li>
    <li>Users can send any of the users on the leaderboard a smile; there is a limit of 5 smiles
        per user, you can only send 1 smile to a user at a time.</li>
    <li>If the current authorized user is on the leaderboard, the smiley button will not be seen on their row 
        since you can't send yourself a smile.
    </li>
    <li>Each user can only send one smile to a user, if you try to send a smile to a user who has
        recieved a smile from you a pop up saying the user has already received a smile shows up, else
        a popup sayign your notifucation has been sent shows up.
    </li>
    <li>The notifications aren't real time, hence the home page has to be refreshed to see 
        new notifications.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3> Change Password </h3>
<ul>
    <li> When this button is clicked, a popup comes up requiring the user to enter 
        their old password and the new password they would like to change it to.
    </li>
    <li> If the old password does not match the user's current password, an error pop up message shows up.</li>
    <li> If the user did not fill teh reuqired fields properly an error pop up message shows up.</li>
    <li> If the user was sucessful in changing their password, they get a sucessful popup message. </li>
</ul>
<h3> Sign up</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The user would be prompted to fill out a form to set up their account.    
    </li>
    <li>
        The form will be displayed as a pop-up page with the Home Page in the background.
    </li>
    <li>The form will contain the following information to be recieved from the user</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First Name
        </li>
        <li>
            <dt>
            Username:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                This will be the identifier for the specific user, it is also unique.
            </dd>
        </li>
        <li>
            <dt>
                Password:
            </dt>
            <dd>
            This is to authenticate the user when they are signing in to the web app.
            </dd>
        </li>

        <li>
            <dt>
            Re-enter Password:
            </dt>
            <dd>
                This addition step to ensure that the user wrote the password correctly the first time.
            </dd>

        </li>

    </ul>
    <li>
        If signing up wasn't sucessful, an error pop up appears; this could be caused by:
        <ul>
            <li> The username already exists in the databse</li>
            <li> The user did not fill out the required fields properly.</li>
        </ul>

        </li>
        <li> If signing up was sucessful, a popup message prompting the user to sign in appears.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Once a user hovers over the notifications icon, this shows the user all the smiles they have receieved (limit to 5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game Categories</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The user can select different categories and their corresponding difficulty levels.</li>
    <li> For the purpose of the project, we will only have three categories seen in the Class Demo category: </li>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            <dt>
                Easy - Animals (Mix and Match):
            </dt>
            <dd>
                Very basic game, that requires the user to select an animal and match it with the matching name or vice-versa by also selecting it.
                <br>
                The score gets updated incrementally, for every correct match, a score of one gets added to the total score. 
                <br>
                If the user selected a wrong option, the two options get deselected.
                Once the user gets a score of 6, an automatic popup letting the user know their score has been added to the database and asking them if 
                they want to play again or head back to the home page.
            </dd>
        </li>
        <li> 
                <dt>
                    Medium - Flags (Drag and Drop):
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    This requires the user to drag the country name to the corresponding flag.
                    <br>
                    The score gets updated incrementally, for every correct match, a score of one gets added to the total score. 
                    <br>
                    Once the user gets a score of 6, an automatic popup letting the user know their score has been added to the database and asking them if 
                    they want to play again or head back to the home page.
                </dd>
        </li>

                <dd>
                </dd>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

        If currently registered user is an admin, an icon appears beside the line welcomming them to the page.
